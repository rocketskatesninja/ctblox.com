        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">The Troubleshooting Mindset</h3>
        <p class="mb-3">Effective troubleshooting is as much about your approach as it is about technical knowledge. Here are some principles to keep in mind:</p>

            <div class="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                <h4 class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Stay Calm and Methodical</h4>
                <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">When your website is having issues, it's easy to panic. Remember that most WordPress problems have been encountered before and can be resolved. Take a deep breath and approach the problem systematically.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                <h4 class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-white">One Change at a Time</h4>
                <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Make one change, then test to see if it resolved the issue. Making multiple changes at once makes it difficult to identify what actually fixed the problem (or potentially created new ones).</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg">
                <h4 class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Document Everything</h4>
                <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Keep track of what you've tried, what worked, and what didn't. This documentation will be invaluable if you encounter similar issues in the future or need to seek additional help.</p>

                <h4 class="font-medium text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Know When to Ask for Help</h4>
                <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">While many WordPress issues can be resolved on your own, some problems might require professional assistance. Know your limits and don't hesitate to seek help for complex issues, especially those involving database problems or server configurations.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">File Transfer Protocol (FTP) clients like FileZilla allow you to access and modify your website files directly, which is essential for certain troubleshooting steps.</p>
