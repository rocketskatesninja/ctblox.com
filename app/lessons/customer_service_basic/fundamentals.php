            <li>
                <h4 class="font-medium">Reliability</h4>
                <p>Consistently deliver on your promises. When you say you'll do something by a certain time, make it happen.</p>
                <div class="bg-green-50 dark:bg-green-900 p-3 rounded-lg mt-2">
                    <p class="text-sm text-green-700 dark:text-green-300"><strong>Example:</strong> If you promise delivery by Thursday, make sure it arrives on Thursday—or better yet, Wednesday.</p>

                    <p class="text-sm text-green-700 dark:text-green-300"><strong>Example:</strong> Aim to respond to all customer inquiries within 1 business hour, even if it's just to acknowledge receipt.</p>
